# Explanation
This algorithm does as suggested in the docstring, and in-line comments.

## Time complexity:
It depends on the size of the url (path), spliting takes O(n) time and finding the path also takes O(n). SO overall complexity is **O(n)**

## Space Complexity:
It depends on the path length Therefore **O(n)**
