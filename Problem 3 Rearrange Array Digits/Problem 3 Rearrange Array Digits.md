# Explaination
This algorithm uses merge sort (Divide and conqure). 
First sort the input_list in decending order. Then Traverse the whole sorted arr and choose which number gives you the largest sum.

## Time complexity
**O(n(log(n)))** because O(nlog(n))+O(n) ~ O(nlog(n))
## Space complexity:
**O(1)**
