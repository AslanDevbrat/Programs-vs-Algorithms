# Explaination

Uses a dictionary to store the letters of words. Lookups and insertions should be faster than a BST.

## Big O Space Complexity

Utilizing a Python dict the worst case is O(n) where n is the length or number of individual tokens in a string.

## Big O Time Complexity

Looking up words as well as inserting and finding a word runs in O(n) where n is the length of the search string.
